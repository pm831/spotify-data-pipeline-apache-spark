Have you ever wondered how you can build an ETL Data Pipeline for Spotify via Apache Spark/PySpark? This article explains how!

## Purpose of Project:

The purpose of the Spotify ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline you are developing is to automate the process of extracting data from Spotify, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into AWS S3 for further analysis and processing. Here are the specific goals and steps involved:
* Extract:
* Transform:
* Load:

## The pipeline facilitates the following:

* Data Organization: By transforming and organizing the data into separate categories, it becomes easier to analyze and query.
* Automation: Automating the data extraction and transformation process saves time and reduces manual effort.
* Scalability: Using AWS services ensures the pipeline can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
* Real-Time Data: Setting up the pipeline to run at regular intervals (e.g., using AWS Lambda and Glue) ensures the data remains up-to-date.

Overall, this pipeline enables efficient management and utilization of Spotify data for further analysis, reporting, or integration with other data systems.

## This tutorial is divided into the following categories:

* spotify_api_data_extract.py
* spotify_transformation.py
* spotify_transformation_load_function.py
* spotify_api_data_extract.py

Here's a breakdown of your AWS Lambda function, which uses the Spotify API to fetch playlist data and stores it in an S3 bucket:
